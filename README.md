# F5-BIGIP Virtual Server for Virtual Private Cloud using Custom Image

With this template, you can use IBM Cloud Schematics to create F5-BIGIP virtual server using custom image from your IBM Cloud account. Schematics uses [Terraform](https://www.terraform.io/) as the infrastructure-as-code engine. With this template, you can create and manage infrastructure as a single unit as follows. For more information about how to use this template, see the [IBM Cloud Schematics documentation](https://cloud.ibm.com/docs/schematics).

**Included**:
* 1. (1) Public-Gateway for given VPC
* 2. (1) Subnet that will be used by F5-BIGIP VSI and attach the public-gateway
* 3. (1) Security-Group with rules to allow access to F5-BIGIP admin portal
* 4. (1) Custom Image using provided F5-BIGIP qcow2
* 5. (1) F5-BIGIP VSI and attach security-group rules
* 6. (1) FIP and attach to primary network interface of F5-BIGIP VSI
* 7. (2) Backend VSI with nginx and customized welcome page (Demo purpose only)

**Not included**:
* This is a poc work.

**Must have IBM IS Terraform Provider fixes**:
* Provide `data source for ibm_login_target` that would provide some key information from provider session (example: account-id)
* Provide `resource for ibm_is_image` - IS Image create, update, delete
* Catalog offering Deployment variable must provide way to mark some variable sensitive (example: vendor svc account apikey)

## Costs

When you apply template, the infrastructure resources that you create incur charges as follows. To clean up the resources, you can [delete your Schematics workspace or your instance](https://cloud.ibm.com/docs/schematics?topic=schematics-manage-lifecycle#destroy-resources). Removing the workspace or the instance cannot be undone. Make sure that you back up any data that you must keep before you start the deletion process.

* **VPC**: VPC charges are incurred for the infrastructure resources within the VPC, as well as network traffic for internet data transfer. For more information, see [Pricing for VPC](https://cloud.ibm.com/docs/vpc-on-classic?topic=vpc-on-classic-pricing-for-vpc).
* **VPC virtual servers**: You specify how many virtual servers to provision in each VPC. The price for your virtual server instances depends on the flavor of the instances, how many you provision, and how long the instances are run. For more information, see [Pricing for Virtual Servers for VPC](https://cloud.ibm.com/docs/infrastructure/vpc-on-classic?topic=vpc-on-classic-pricing-for-vpc#pricing-for-virtual-servers-for-vpc).

## Dependencies

Before you can apply the template in IBM Cloud, complete the following steps.

1.  Make sure that you have the following permissions in IBM Cloud Identity and Access Management:
    * **Manager** service access role for IBM Cloud Schematics
    * **Operator** platform role for VPC Infrastructure
2.  Ensure given VPC and SSHKey already exists in your account.

## Configuring your deployment values

When you select the [`vnf-f5-vpc`template](https://cloud.ibm.com/catalog/content/vnf-f5-vpc) from the IBM Cloud catalog, you set up your deployment variables from the **Create** page. When you apply the template, IBM Cloud Schematics provisions the resources according to the values that you specify for these variables.

### Required values
Fill in the following values, based on the steps that you completed before you began.

|Variable Name|Description|
|-------------|-----------|
|`ssh_public_key`|Enter the [public SSH key](https://cloud.ibm.com/docs/vpc-on-classic-vsi?topic=vpc-on-classic-vsi-ssh-keys) that you use to access your VPC virtual servers. Use the public key from the `~/.ssh/id_rsa.pub` file generated by the latest version of ssh-keygen tool, with the recommended key-size 2048.|

### Optional values
Before you apply your template, you can customize the following default variable values.

|Variable Name|Description|Default Value|
|-------------|-----------|-------------|
|`ibmcloud_api_key`|[Temp hack] to workaround IBM IS Provider (Image Create) gap. The APIKey of the IBM Cloud account where resources will be provisioned.|`None`|
|`ibmcloud_vnf_svc_api_key`|The APIKey of the IBM Cloud NFV service account that is hosting the F5-BIGIP qcow2 image file.|`None`|
|`generation`|The VPC Generation to target. Valid values are 2 or 1..|`2`|
|`region`|The VPC Region that you want your VPC to be provisioned. To list available zones, run `ibmcloud is regions`.|`us-south`|
|`zone`|The VPC Zone that you want your VPC virtual servers to be provisioned. To list available zones, run `ibmcloud is zones`.|`us-south-1`|
|`resource_group`|The resource group to use. If unspecified, the account's default resource group is used. To list available resource groups, run `ibmcloud resource groups`.|`Default`|
|`vpc_name`|The name of your VPC in which F5-BIGIP VSI is to be provisioned.|`None`|
|`ssh_key_name`|The name of your public SSH key to be used for F5-BIGIP VSI.|`None`|
|`f5_image_name`|The name of the F5 custom image to be provisioned in your IBM Cloud account.|`f5-bigip-15-0-1-0-0-11`|
|`f5_vsi_name`|The name of your F5 Virtual Server to be provisioned.|`f5-1arm-vsi`|
|`f5_profile`|Enter the profile of compute CPU and memory resources that you want your F5-BIGIP virtual servers to have. To list available profiles, run `ibmcloud is instance-profiles`.|`bx2-2x8`|
|`f5_license`|Optional: The BYOL license key that you want your F5 virtual server in a VPC to be used by registration flow during cloud-init.|`None`|
|`vnf_f5bigip_cos_instance_id`|Hidden: The COS instance-id hosting the F5-BIGIP qcow2 image.|`NA`|
|`vnf_f5bigip_cos_image_url`|The COS image object url for F5-BIGIP qcow2 image.|`NA`|

## Outputs
After you apply the template your VPC resources are successfully provisioned in IBM Cloud, you can review information such as the virtual server IP addresses and VPC identifiers in the Schematics log files, in the `Terraform SHOW` section.

|Variable Name|Description|Default Value|
|-------------|-----------|-------------|
|f5_admin_portal|Web url to interact with F5-BIGIP admin portal.|`None`|
